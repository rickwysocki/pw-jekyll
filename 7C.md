  The 7 C's are clear, concise, concrete and specific, complete, courteous, coherent, and constructive.

You can find a more in-depth descripton for each of tthe 7 C's below.

- Clear: Ensure you write in a way that is easy to understand. Use clear or transparent langugae and stick to the main topic. Try to avoid jargon or technical words. 
- Concise: Ensure that your writing is brief and to the point. Try to eliminate any repitition or segments of redundancy. Remember that the more concise your writing is, the clearer it is to read. 
- Concrete and Specific: Your writing should be specific and vividly written. This can be achieved through the use of facts and vivid details onn the subject matter. Avoid the use of vague statements. Give as much detail and information as possible. 
- Complete: Ensure that you give all the necessary information in your writing. Your audience should fully understand the message you are conveying when finished reading. Most complete writing can answer most or all of the following questions: Who, what, when, where, why, and sometimes how. 
- Courteous: Be as respectful and considerate of others as possible, while also being tactful. Try to be as gender neutral as possible, put the audience first, and make your writing format reader friendly. 
- Coherent: Ensure that your writing flows easily from one thing to the next. Carefully construct your paragraphs on one topic, be consistent with your formatting, write sentences with one main idea in mind. 
- Constructive: Ensure that your writing style avoids emphasis on the negative. Good professional writing should focus on the positive in the situation. Along with this, it is important to avoid telling your audience that they can't do something. Always focus on what you can do.
