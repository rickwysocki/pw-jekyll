# Effective File Managment 

When creating an effective file management system, you must be consistant. Decide which aspects of your files are most important, use this to create your conventions. These could include **date** (DDMMYYYY) or **version number** (v01/v02) or **contents** (Bolivia Research)
Avoid using spaces or special characters and opt for capitilization, hyphens, or underscores.
