When you are collabing in a group it is possible that people will have different visual styles, different styles of writing, etc. The question becomes how do you make these differing styles go well together? One may 
  even have a different style of grammar and make more errors. 
  To work together well as a group you should discuss things first. Discuss who is doing what. Discuss the general vibe/feel of the paper. Is it professional? Is it instructions for someone? Perhaps one person could write and then
the other could revise the paper. While revising make sure that it all flows together well and changing up pieces/parts to sound similar is not that hard.
